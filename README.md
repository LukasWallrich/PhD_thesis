This repository contains data, code and materials for my PhD - as well as the submitted version of the thesis (the viva is still pending).

## Structure

The materials for each empirical chapter are contained in a separate folder. Most of these folders contain a `materials`-folder that contains questionnaires and other study materials, as well as an `analysis` folder that contains data and code.

Several of the studies were based on collaborative data collection efforts that contained questions relevant to other research projects. Therefore, I cannot always share full datasets, but only the responses relevant to the research contained in my dissertation. Please contact me for access to full datasets and I will see what I can do.

## OSF access

All materials in this repository can also be accessed through the [OSF project](https://osf.io/f47cb/?view_only=9576eb56688d4c0198de1022f81e8b82) associated with my PhD.
