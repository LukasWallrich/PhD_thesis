This repository contains data, code and materials for my PhD. At present, it will be filled as I finalize draft chapters.

## Structure

The materials for each empirical chapter are contained in a separate folder. Each of these folders contains a `materials`-folder that contains questionnaires and other study materials, as well as an `analysis` folder that contains data and code.

## Dissertation text and OSF access

All materials in this repository can also be accessed through the OSF project associated with my PhD. That project will also contain the thesis, once submitted.
