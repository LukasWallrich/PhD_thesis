This repository contains data, code and materials for my PhD. At present, it will be filled as I finalize draft chapters.

## Structure

The materials for each empirical chapter are contained in a separate folder. Each of these folders contains a `materials`-folder that contains questionnaires and other study materials, as well as an `analysis` folder that contains data and code.

Several of the studies were based on collaborative data collection efforts that contained questions relevant to other research projects. Therefore, I cannot share full datasets in most cases, but only the responses relevant to the research contained in my dissertation. Please contact me for access to full datasets and I will see what I can do.

## Dissertation text and OSF access

All materials in this repository can also be accessed through the [OSF project](https://osf.io/f47cb/?view_only=9576eb56688d4c0198de1022f81e8b82) associated with my PhD. That project will also contain the thesis text, once submitted.
